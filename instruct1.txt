    you have a table places containing a list of places in bangalore with schema (place_id, name, latitude ,longitude , description, category, address, phone, website, description, description_vector)
    eg. of id 1,2,3,4...
    eg. of name Kempegowda International Airport, Bangalore Palace...
    eg. latitude 13.199969, 12.9982...

        SELECT *
        FROM places
        ORDER BY description_vector <=> azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-ada-002', 'food')::vector 
        LIMIT 10
    ) AS subquery
    ORDER BY place_id;
